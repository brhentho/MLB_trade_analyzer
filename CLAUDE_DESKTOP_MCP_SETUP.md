# Claude Desktop MCP Setup for Baseball Trade AI

This guide explains how to integrate the Baseball Trade AI MCP server with Claude Desktop.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Test MCP Integration

First, verify that the MCP integration works:

```bash
# Make sure you've set up your .env file with Supabase credentials
python3 test_mcp.py
```

This should show all tests passing if your database is properly configured.

### 2. Configure Claude Desktop

1. **Find your Claude Desktop config directory**:
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/`
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\`
   - **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/`

2. **Edit the `claude_desktop_config.json` file** (create if it doesn't exist):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "baseball-trade-ai": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": [
        "/Users/brycehenthorn/Desktop/github repos/MLB_trade_analyzer/mcp_server.py",
        "--serve"
      ],
      "env": {
        "SUPABASE_URL": "https://your-actual-project-id.supabase.co",
        "SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY": "your-actual-service-role-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: Replace the file path and environment variables with your actual values!

### 3. Restart Claude Desktop

Close and reopen Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect.

## üõ† Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Connecting
1. Check that the file path in the config is correct
2. Verify your environment variables are set
3. Test with `python3 mcp_server.py` manually
4. Check Claude Desktop logs for errors

### Database Connection Issues
1. Run `python3 test_setup.py` to verify database access
2. Check your Supabase credentials in `.env`
3. Ensure you've run the database migrations

### Permission Errors
1. Make sure Python 3 is in your PATH
2. Check file permissions on the MCP server script
3. Try running with full Python path if needed

### No Data Returned
1. Verify you've seeded data with `python3 seed_historical_data.py`
2. Check that teams and players exist in your database
3. Test individual tools with `python3 test_mcp.py`

## üîç Debugging

### View MCP Server Logs
Run the server manually to see detailed logs:
```bash
python3 mcp_server.py --serve
```

### Test Individual Tools
```python
# Test in Python
from backend.services.supabase_mcp import get_teams, get_players

# Get teams
teams = await get_teams(limit=5)
print(teams)

# Get players
players = await get_players(min_war=2.0, limit=10)
print(players)
```

## üéØ Next Steps

Once MCP is working:

1. **Seed your database** with historical data
2. **Explore team rosters** and player statistics
3. **Create trade analyses** for your favorite teams
4. **Build custom queries** using the available tools
