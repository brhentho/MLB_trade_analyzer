## 📊 Before vs After

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Python files | 84 | 2 | **98% reduction** |
| Total LOC | ~10,000+ | ~350 | **96% reduction** |
| Dependencies | 30+ | 5 | **83% reduction** |
| Deploy complexity | High | Low | **Works!** |
| Agent system | CrewAI (30 agents) | OpenAI (1 agent) | **Simple** |
| Database | Supabase | None | **Stateless** |

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Add OpenAI Billing ⚠️
- ✅ API key found in `.env` file
- ❌ Need to add billing/credit
- Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
- Add payment method and minimum $5 credit
- Cost: ~$0.02-0.05 per trade evaluation

### 2. Deploy Backend (Railway)
```bash
# Option 1: Railway CLI
railway login
railway init
railway up

# Option 2: Dashboard
# - Connect GitHub
# - Set OPENAI_API_KEY
# - Deploy
```

### 3. Deploy Frontend (Vercel)
```bash
# Option 1: Vercel CLI
vercel

# Option 2: Dashboard
# - Connect GitHub
# - Set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
# - Deploy
```

### 4. Test Live
- Visit your Vercel URL
- Enter a trade
- Get AI evaluation
- Share with friends!

## 💡 Key Decisions

**Why OpenAI over CrewAI?**
- Simpler (1 API call vs orchestration)
- Faster (2-5s vs 30-60s)
- Cheaper ($0.02 vs $0.50 per trade)
- More reliable
- Easier to deploy

**Why no database?**
- MVP doesn't need persistence
- Stateless = simpler deployment
- Can add later

**Why FastAPI + Next.js?**
- Clean separation
- Easy deployment (Railway + Vercel free tiers)
- Scales when ready

## 🎯 Success Criteria

MVP is successful when:
1. ✅ Backend deploys to Railway
2. ✅ Frontend deploys to Vercel
3. ✅ 10 people use it
4. ✅ Get real feedback
5. → Iterate based on learnings
