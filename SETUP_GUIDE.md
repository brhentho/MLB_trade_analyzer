## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

1. **Start the Backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python3 main.py
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the System**
   - Open http://localhost:3001
   - Select a team (e.g., "New York Yankees")
   - Enter a trade request: "Find me a starting pitcher with ERA under 4.0"
   - Click "Analyze Trade"

## 🤖 AI Features Currently Active

## 🔧 Optional Enhancements

### **Level 1: Real AI Analysis** (Recommended)
Add OpenAI API key to get GPT-powered analysis:

1. Get API key from https://platform.openai.com/
2. Add to `backend/.env`:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. Restart backend - you'll get real AI analysis instead of pattern-based

### **Level 2: Database Persistence**
Set up Supabase for full data persistence:

1. Create project at https://supabase.com
2. Run migrations in `supabase/migrations/`
3. Add credentials to `backend/.env`
4. Run `python setup_supabase.py` to verify

## 🎯 What You Can Do Right Now

### **Test Different Trade Scenarios**
- "I need a closer who can pitch in high leverage situations"
- "Find me a power hitter for the middle of our lineup" 
- "We need a starting pitcher with at least 3 years of control"
- "Look for a utility infielder who can play multiple positions"

### **Try Different Teams**
- Select different MLB teams to see how needs change
- Test both contending and rebuilding team scenarios
- Compare American League vs National League approaches

### **Explore API Endpoints**
- `/api/health` - Check system status
- `/api/teams` - View all 30 MLB teams
- `/api/quick-analysis` - Submit trade requests
- `/api/analysis/{id}` - Check analysis results

                                   - Business Ops
                                   - Commissioner
```

## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

### **Check System Status**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
```

### **View Logs**
- Backend logs show AI analysis progress
- Look for "CrewAI components loaded" message
- OpenAI available shows as True/False

### **Common Issues**
- **Port conflicts**: Frontend uses 3001 if 3000 is busy
- **Missing teams**: Check that backend started successfully
- **AI not working**: Verify OpenAI API key in environment
